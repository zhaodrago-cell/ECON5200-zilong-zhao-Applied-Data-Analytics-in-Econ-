# 📊 Economic Data Science Portfolio

Welcome! This GitHub repository is my digital portfolio for **ECON 5200: Applied Data Analytics in Economics**. I’m building this space to document my learning process, showcase hands-on projects, and demonstrate how I apply modern data tools to real economic questions.

## 👋 About Me  
I am an **[under/graduate]** economics student seeking opportunities in **[Data Analysis / Economic Consulting / Finance]**.  
My goal is to show that I can **bridge traditional economic theory with modern data science**—combining rigorous economic thinking with practical, reproducible analytics.

## 🧠 About This Portfolio  
This repository hosts my course **labs, assignments, and applied analyses**. The course follows a **Concept Extension** philosophy: we start with foundational statistical ideas (like **regression and inference**) and extend them into scalable methods from machine learning (like **regularization and model selection with Lasso**).

A key focus of my work is learning to combine:

- **Causal inference**: asking *why* something happens, using careful identification and interpretation  
- **Predictive analytics**: forecasting and pattern-finding using machine learning workflows  

By practicing both, I’m building the ability to produce analysis that is **economically meaningful**, **data-driven**, and **decision-relevant**.
